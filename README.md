Use Scala Macros to add compilation safety to Playframework's i18n
===================================================================

`sbt run` to run locally.

When you run, you will see that there are 2 compilation errors in `index.scala.html`; one is for invalid key and another is for invalid number of arguments.

I hope you enjoy this trick to avoid future headache!
